# ShopChat — Pitch Outline (90–120s)

**Problem** — In-store help is slow. Staff are busy, signage is stale, and shoppers give up.
**Insight** — The only moment that matters is *now*, in *this aisle*. No one wants to install an app.

**Solution** — Scan a QR to join an ephemeral chat for this aisle. Ask, get tips, see staff broadcasts. Auto-expires.

**Why now (2025)** — Retail is pushing in-store engagement; QR is mainstream; privacy concerns favor no-login flows.

**Demo** — Judge scans QR → instant join → asks “Where’s 27'' IPS?” → Bot answers (Aisle 7, shelf 3) → Staff pins coupon.

**Secret sauce** — 0-friction join + ephemeral rooms + store tools (broadcast, analytics) in one web app.

**Safety** — Basic moderation, auto-mute after 3 strikes, no DMs, TTL rooms.

**Market** — B2B SaaS $/location/month; measurable conversion via redemptions.

**Roadmap** — Translation, verified staff SSO, product inventory integrations, analytics (questions resolved).

**Ask** — Pilot at 2 stores; measure time-to-answer and coupon lift.
